## Abstract
The purpose of this project is to create our own Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) utilizing the Million Instructions Per Second (MIPS) ISA. Throughout this process, we will document each step which then will be combined into a Programmers Reference Manual. This project is designed with the intent to help people who want an in-depth understanding of computer architecture with the intent to further apply the knowledge learned to their work on software applications. We will be discussing the specific details surrounding registers and their applications, along with operands, data types, addressing modes, and binary instructions.

## Application
MIPS programming offers many different features applicable to programmers. What is dynamic about this is that programmers are able to build their own conventional projects by using the available registers. One case of this is Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD). An example of using SIMD is generating graphics. AltiVec Technology uses 32 x 128-bit “vector” registers to display graphics. We utilized this aspect into creating our own MIPS instructions
